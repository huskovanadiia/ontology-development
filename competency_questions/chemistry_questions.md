# General remarks

To simplify writing the questions variables are used inside the questions. Variable allways start with X as the first Variable and then continue with Y,Z,U,V,W as the respective placeholder.
Many of the questions allow for non-trivial permutations, for which reasons it might be best to also list these permutation blocks.


# Reaction related question

- which reactions produce substance X?

- which components have substance X as an intermediate product?

- which reaction can be inhibited by small concentrations of substance X?

- which ligand are sufficently robust for the reactionconditions of reaction X?


# Measurement related question

- which measurement technique was used?

- which detector was used?

- which calibartion technique was used?

- how large is the measurement range of device X ?



# Catalyst related question

## Catalytic Component related question

- give me all catalysts which contain component X ?

- which reaction can be catalysed by substance X ?

- Which products can a combination of Educt X and Y produce ?

- Which educts can produce product X while not having components Y, Z as products?

- Which reaction experiments  are catalysed by the reaction vessel rather than by the catalytic sample?

- which reactions are catalysed reactions ?

- which side reactions can i expect in a mixture consisting of substances X?
